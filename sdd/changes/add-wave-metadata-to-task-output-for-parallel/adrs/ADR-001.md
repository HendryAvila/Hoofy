# Wave metadata as optional parameter, not structural change

**Status:** accepted

## Context

Adding parallel execution wave groupings to task output. Could either: (A) add a new optional string parameter to sdd_create_tasks, (B) restructure TasksData to have typed Wave structs with parsed task assignments, or (C) add a separate sdd_assign_waves tool.

## Decision

Option A — simple optional string parameter `wave_assignments` on sdd_create_tasks. The AI generates the wave content as markdown, Hoofy stores it in the template. Conditional template rendering via `{{ if .WaveAssignments }}`.

## Rationale

Hoofy tools are STORAGE tools — the AI generates content, tools save it. Adding typed structs (option B) would mean Hoofy validates/parses wave assignments, which violates this principle. A separate tool (option C) adds complexity for a feature that's tightly coupled to task creation. Option A is consistent with how all other optional params work (dependency_graph, acceptance_criteria) — freeform markdown strings that the template renders conditionally.

## Alternatives Rejected

Option B (typed Wave structs): Over-engineering for a storage tool. Would need parsing, validation, wave number enforcement — all work the AI should do. Option C (separate sdd_assign_waves tool): Unnecessary tool proliferation. Waves are part of the task breakdown, not a separate artifact.
