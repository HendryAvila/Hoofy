# Research Foundations

Every Hoofy feature is grounded in published research. This document maps each capability to the specific research that informed it — what it recommends, and how Hoofy implements it.

## Anthropic Engineering

### [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) (Dec 2024)

Foundational patterns for agent design. Distinguishes workflows from agents, introduces the concept of Agent-Computer Interface (ACI), and establishes that tool design matters as much as prompt design.

| Recommendation | Hoofy Implementation |
|---|---|
| "Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) is as important as HCI" — tool descriptions and parameters are critical for AI usability | All 34 tools use consistent `sdd_*` and `mem_*` namespacing with self-documenting parameter descriptions |
| "Do the simplest thing that works" — avoid over-engineering agent systems | Adaptive change pipeline selects only the stages needed (4-7 stages based on type x size), instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all workflow |
| Orchestrator-worker pattern for complex tasks | Project pipeline uses sequential orchestration: propose → specify → clarify → design → tasks → validate |
| Evaluator-optimizer pattern for iterative refinement | Clarity Gate blocks pipeline advancement until clarity score meets threshold, forcing iterative requirement refinement |

### [Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) (Sep 2025)

The most relevant article for Hoofy's memory system. Defines context as a finite resource with diminishing marginal returns, and presents strategies for managing it.

| Recommendation | Hoofy Implementation |
|---|---|
| "Structured note-taking / agentic memory" — agent writes notes persisted outside the context window, pulls them back later | `mem_save` persists observations to SQLite with FTS5 full-text search. `mem_context` and `mem_search` retrieve them in future sessions |
| "Progressive disclosure" — agents discover context layer by layer, keeping only what's necessary | `mem_search` → `mem_timeline` → `mem_get_observation` pattern: search first, drill into timeline, then read full content |
| "Sub-agent architectures" — specialized sub-agents with clean context windows, return condensed summaries | Knowledge graph with `mem_build_context` traverses relations from any observation. `namespace` parameter on 7 memory tools (`mem_save`, `mem_save_prompt`, `mem_session_summary`, `mem_progress`, `mem_search`, `mem_context`, `mem_compact`) enables opt-in isolation — each sub-agent tags observations with its namespace, reads only its own notes, while the orchestrator omits namespace to see everything |
| "Hybrid strategy" — some data retrieved up front, other data explored just-in-time | `mem_context` loads recent history at session start (up front). `mem_search` retrieves specific memories on demand (just-in-time) |
| "Context is a finite resource" — treat it like an attention budget | 5 read-heavy tools support `detail_level: summary | standard | full` to control response verbosity: `sdd_get_context`, `mem_context`, `mem_search`, `mem_timeline`, `sdd_context_check`. Summary-mode responses include a footer hint for progressive disclosure. `sdd_get_context` defaults to `summary` (minimal pipeline overview) to save tokens on the most frequently called pipeline tool |
| "You have to be smart about managing what goes into context" — stale and redundant data degrades performance over time | `mem_compact` identifies stale observations (older than N days) and batch soft-deletes them. Optionally creates a "compaction_summary" observation to preserve key knowledge. Two-step workflow: identify candidates → review → compact with summary |

### [Writing Effective Tools for Agents — with Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents) (Sep 2025)

Direct guidance on tool design for AI agents. Covers namespacing, consolidation, response format, truncation, and token efficiency.

| Recommendation | Hoofy Implementation |
|---|---|
| "Namespacing tools with prefixes helps delineate boundaries" | `mem_*` (19 memory tools), `sdd_*` (9 project pipeline tools), `sdd_change*` (5 change tools) — clear boundaries between systems |
| "Return only high-signal information, avoid cryptic UUIDs" | Tool responses include human-readable summaries, not raw database rows. `detail_level` parameter lets the AI request only the verbosity needed |
| "Tools should be self-contained, robust to error, extremely clear" | Each tool has comprehensive parameter descriptions with examples in the tool definition |
| "Truncate tool responses, but always include total counts" | `mem_search`, `mem_context`, and `mem_timeline` append navigation hints ("📊 Showing X of Y") when results are capped by limit. `NavigationHint()` returns empty string when all results are shown (no noise) |

### [How We Built Our Multi-Agent Research System](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system) (Jun 2025)

Architecture lessons from Anthropic's multi-agent Research feature. Key insights on token efficiency, orchestration, and memory management.

| Recommendation | Hoofy Implementation |
|---|---|
| "Long-horizon conversation management: agents summarize completed phases, store in external memory" | `mem_session_summary` captures structured summaries (Goal, Discoveries, Accomplished, Files) at session end for future sessions |
| "Subagents output to filesystem to minimize 'game of telephone'" | All pipeline artifacts are written to `sdd/*.md` files on disk, not passed through conversation history |
| "Each sub-agent works independently with its own context" — parallel agents need memory isolation | `namespace` parameter provides opt-in memory scoping. Sub-agents tag observations with `namespace="subagent/<task-id>"`, reads filter by namespace. Orchestrator omits namespace to see all. Convention: `subagent/<task-id>` or `agent/<role>` |
| "Token usage explains 80% of performance variance" — more tokens does not equal better results | Topic key upsert (`mem_save` with `topic_key`) prevents memory duplication. One observation per topic, always current |

### [Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) (Nov 2025)

Solutions for agents that work across multiple context windows. Introduces the initializer agent pattern, incremental progress, and structured handoffs.

| Recommendation | Hoofy Implementation |
|---|---|
| "Each session: read progress, read git log, run basic test, then start new work" | `mem_progress` persists structured JSON progress docs that survive context compaction. Auto-read at session start, upserted during work. One active progress per project via topic_key. `mem_context` provides recent observations for broader session context |
| "Feature list in JSON (not Markdown) — model less likely to inappropriately change JSON" | Pipeline state persisted in `sdd/sdd.json` (JSON), not markdown. `mem_progress` content is validated JSON — the model is less likely to corrupt structured data than free-form markdown |
| "Agent commits to git with descriptive messages after each feature" | Change pipeline enforces incremental delivery: one active change at a time, verify stage before completion |
| "Initializer agent sets up environment on first run" | `sdd_init_project` creates the `sdd/` directory structure, `sdd.json` config, and templates — environment scaffolding before any work begins |

### [Claude Code: Best Practices for Agentic Coding](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) (Apr 2025)

Best practices for getting the most out of AI coding assistants. Covers CLAUDE.md, custom instructions, and structured workflows.

| Recommendation | Hoofy Implementation |
|---|---|
| Use CLAUDE.md for persistent project context | Context-check stage scans `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and other convention files for conflicts with the current change |
| Structure specifications before coding | Full greenfield pipeline (propose → specify → business rules → clarity gate → design → tasks → validate) enforces specs before any code is written |
